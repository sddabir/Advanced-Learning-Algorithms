# Advanced-Learning-Algorithms

Projects based on advanced machine learning algorithms from the Advanced Learning Algorithms course. So far, I have learned from this course to:
•Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
• Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
• Build and use decision trees
